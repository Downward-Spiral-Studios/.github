Hello! We are Downward Spiral Studios, a small indie team of passionate creators. We aim to create unique, memorable, and enjoyable games that will leave you feeling satisfied.
One of our current projects, Specterelic, is a cozy museum management simulator where you make deals with ghosts to bump up a failing museumâ€™s catalog.
